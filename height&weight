# Step 1: Load the built-in dataset 'women'
data("women")

# Step 2: Create a factor for height
# Define the breaks for categorizing height
breaks <- c(50, 60, 70)

# Create a factor based on height categories
height_factor <- cut(women$height, breaks = breaks, labels = c("Short", "Medium", "Tall"), include.lowest = TRUE)

# Print the original dataset and the created factor
cat("Original dataset 'women':\n")
