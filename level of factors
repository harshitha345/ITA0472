# Step 1: Create a factor from a random sample of LETTERS
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
random_letters <- sample(LETTERS, 20, replace = TRUE)  # Random sample of 20 letters
factor_letters <- factor(random_letters)

# Print the original factor and its levels
cat("Original factor:\n")
print(factor_letters)

# Step 2: Extract five levels from the factor
five_levels <- levels(factor_letters)[1:5]

# Print the extracted five levels
cat("\nFive levels from the factor:\n")
print(five_levels)
